## About this apliccation

In this application, you will find an interface that closely resembles what Twitter looked like in the past. Here, you can create tweets, like them, and even leave comments on them.

We have a section dedicated to editing your profile, where you can adjust your name and choose a profile picture and banner that best suit your preferences. You can also follow your contacts and see how many followers and likes you have. Finally, we offer a small statistical module that allows you to view your likes and analyze their daily and weekly trends.
